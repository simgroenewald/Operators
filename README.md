Compulsory Task
Follow these steps:

● Design a program that determines the award a person competing in a triathlon
will receive.
● Your program should read in the times in minutes for all three events of a
triathlon, namely swimming, cycling and running and then calculate and display
the total time taken to complete the triathlon.
● Your program should also read in the position the participant places in the
triathlon. (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, …)
● The award a participant receives is based on the total time taken to complete the
triathlon. Display the award the participant will receive based on the following
criteria:
○ If the time taken for a participant to complete the triathlon is less than or
equal to 100 minutes and they placed first (i.e. 1) they receive Provincial
Colours.
○ If the time taken for a participant to complete the triathlon is less than or
equal to 110 minutes and they placed first or second they receive

or equal to 115 minutes they receive a Provincial Scroll.
